# DNS & SSL Setup

Configure DNS and SSL certificates for production deployments.

<Info>
All steps in this guide are optional. They are only required if you want to use a domain name and HTTPS.
</Info>

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure DNS (Optional)">

Configure DNS records pointing to your server.

<Note>
You need a domain name and access to your DNS provider's control panel.
</Note>

In your DNS provider, add the following records:

- **A Record**: `oriso.yourdomain.com → YOUR_SERVER_IP`
- **Wildcard A Record** (optional): `*.oriso.yourdomain.com → YOUR_SERVER_IP`

<Check>
Verify DNS resolution:
```bash
nslookup oriso.yourdomain.com
# Should return your server IP
```
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Install Certbot for Let's Encrypt (Optional)">

Install Certbot to obtain free SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

<Warning>
This requires port 80 to be open and DNS to be configured correctly.
</Warning>

```bash
# Install Certbot
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Get SSL certificate (requires port 80 open and DNS configured)
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com

# Certificate will be saved to:
# /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
# /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem

# Setup auto-renewal
sudo systemctl enable certbot.timer
sudo systemctl start certbot.timer
```

<Check>
Verify certificate files exist:
```bash
ls -la /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/
```
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Nginx with SSL (Optional)">

Update Nginx configuration to use SSL certificates.

```bash
# Update Nginx ConfigMap with SSL configuration
kubectl edit configmap oriso-nginx-config -n caritas
```

Add SSL server block configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/certs/privkey.pem;
    # ... rest of configuration
}
```

Mount SSL certificates as volume in Nginx deployment, then reload:

```bash
# Reload Nginx
kubectl rollout restart deployment/cob-proxy -n caritas
```

<Note>
See ORISO-Nginx/DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed SSL configuration instructions.
